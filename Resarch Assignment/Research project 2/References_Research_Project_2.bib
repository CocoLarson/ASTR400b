    abstract = {We present shape measurements of Milky Way–sized dark matter haloes at redshift z = 0 in a suite of 30 zoom simulations from the Auriga project. We compare the results in full magnetohydrodynamics against dark matter–only simulations and find a strong influence of baryons in making dark matter haloes rounder at all radii compared to their dark matter–only counterparts. At distances ≲30 kpc, rounder dark matter distributions correlate with extended massive stellar discs and low-core gas densities. We measure the alignment between the halo and the disc shapes at different radii and find a high degree of alignment at all radii for most of the galaxies. In some cases, the alignment significantly changes as a function of radius implying that the halo shape twists; this effect correlates with recently formed bulges and is almost absent in the dark matter–only simulations. In a comparison against observational constraints, we find that \$20\{\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\}\}\$ of haloes in our sample are consistent with observational results derived from the Pal 5 stream that favours an almost spherical shape. Including baryons is a required element to achieve this level of agreement. In contrast, none of the simulations (neither dark matter only nor with baryons) match the constraints derived from the Sagittarius stream that favour an oblate dark matter halo.},

    abstract = {We use N-body/gasdynamical cosmological simulations to examine the effect of the assembly of a central galaxy on the shape and mass profile of its surrounding dark matter halo. Two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only the evolution of the dark matter component of individual haloes in the proper Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological context, and a second series where a baryonic component is added and followed hydrodynamically. The simulations with baryons include radiative cooling but neglect the formation of stars and their feedback. The efficient, unimpeded cooling that results leads most baryons to collect at the halo centre in a centrifugally supported disc which, due to angular momentum losses, is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral galaxies. This admittedly unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effect that galaxies may have in transforming their surrounding dark haloes. We find, in agreement with earlier work, that the shape of the halo becomes more axisymmetric: post galaxy assembly, haloes are transformed from triaxial into essentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughly constant flattening (〈c/a〉∼ 0.85). Haloes always contract as a result of galaxy assembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the traditional ‘adiabatic-contraction’ hypothesis. The reduced contraction helps to reconcile ΛCDM haloes with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solar circle and should alleviate the longstanding difficulty of matching simultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy discs and the galaxy luminosity function. The halo contraction we report is also less pronounced than found in earlier simulations, a disagreement which suggests that halo contraction is not solely a function of the initial and final distribution of baryons. Not only how much baryonic mass has been deposited at the centre of a halo matters, but also the mode of its deposition. Although simple formulae might work in particular cases where galaxies form nearly adiabatically, in general it might prove impossible to predict the halo response to galaxy formation without a detailed understanding of a galaxy's detailed assembly history.},

    abstract = {The structural properties of individual dark matter haloes, including shape, spin, concentration, and substructure, are linked to the halo’s growth history, but the exact connection between the two is unclear. One open question, in particular, is the effect of major mergers on halo structure. We have performed a large set of simulations of binary equal-mass mergers between isolated haloes with various density profiles, to map out the relationship between the initial conditions and merger parameters and the structure of the final remnant. In this paper we describe our initial set-up and analysis methods, and report on the results for the size, shape, and spin of the merger remnant. The outcomes of mergers are most easily understood in terms of a scaled dimensionless energy parameter κ and an angular momentum (or spin) parameter λ. We find that the axial ratio c/a scales roughly linearly with energy κ while the axial ratio c/b scales linearly with spin λ. Qualitatively, mergers on radial orbits produce prolate remnants, while mergers on tangential orbits produce oblate remnants. The spin of the remnant can be predicted from angular momentum conservation, while the overall size changes as ∼κ−5, as expected from self-similar scaling at constant mean density. We discuss potential cosmological applications for these simple patterns.},

    abstract = {Several lines of evidence suggest that as dark matter haloes grow their scale radius increases, and that the density in their central region drops. Major mergers seem an obvious mechanism to explain both these phenomena, and the resulting patterns in the concentration–mass–redshift relation. To test this possibility, we have simulated equal-mass mergers between haloes with a variety of cosmological density profiles, placed on various different orbits. The remnants typically have higher densities than the initial conditions, but differ only slightly from self-similar scaling predictions. They are reasonably well fit by Einasto profiles, but have parameters distinct from those of the initial conditions. The net internal energy available to the merger remnant, relative to the internal energy of the initial conditions, κ, has the greatest influence on the properties of the final mass distribution. As expected, energetic encounters produce more extended remnants while mergers of strongly bound systems produce compact remnants. Surprisingly, however, the scale radius of the density profile shows the opposite trend, increasing in the remnants of low-energy encounters relative to energetic ones. Also even in the most energetic encounters, the density within the scale radius decreases only slightly (by 10–20 per cent), while for very low-energy systems it increases significantly after the merger. We conclude that while major mergers can produce remnants that are more diffuse at large radii, they are relatively ineffective at changing the central densities of haloes, and seem unlikely to explain the mean trends in the concentration–mass–redshift relation.},

    abstract = {We study the effect of baryonic processes on the shapes of dark matter (DM) haloes from Illustris, a suite of hydrodynamical (Illustris) and DM-only (Illustris-Dark) cosmological simulations performed with the moving-mesh code arepo. DM halo shapes are determined using an iterative method based on the inertia tensor for a wide range of \$z\$ = 0 masses (\$M\_\{200\} = 1 \\times 10^\{11\}\\hbox\{-\}3 \\times 10^\{14\} \\, \\mathrm\{M\}\_\\odot\$). Convergence tests show that the local DM shape profiles are converged only for r \&gt; 9ε, ε being the Plummer-equivalent softening length, 1.4 kpc for the highest resolution run. Haloes from non-radiative simulations (neglecting radiative processes, star formation, and feedback) exhibit no alteration in shapes from their DM-only counterparts: thus moving-mesh hydrodynamics alone is insufficient to cause differences in DM shapes. With the full galaxy-physics implementation, baryons result in significantly rounder and more oblate haloes. For halo masses \$\{\\lesssim\}10^\{12.5\} \\, \\rm M\_\{\\odot \}\$, the median minor-to-major axial ratio 〈s ≡ c/a〉 ≈ 0.7, almost invariant throughout the halo. This somewhat improves the agreement between simulation predictions and observational estimates of the Milky Way (MW) halo shape. Consistently, the velocity anisotropy of DM is also reduced in Illustris, across halo masses and radii. Within the inner halo (r = 0.15R200), both s and q (intermediate-to-major axial ratio) exhibit non-monotonicity with galaxy mass, peaking at \$m\_* \\approx 10^\{10.5-11\} \\, \\mathrm\{M\}\_\\odot\$, which we find is due to the strong dependence of inner halo shape with galaxy formation efficiency. Baryons also affect the correlation of halo shape with halo properties, leading to a positive correlation of sphericity of MW-mass haloes with halo formation time and concentration, the latter being mildly more pronounced than in Illustris-Dark.},
